In August this year, I bought a pro2 for fun on an impulse. Well, here comes the experience of getting angry. I didn't use it after buying it. It was on the bedside table. One day, it accidentally fell to the floor, and the screen cracked a stripe. I was quite puzzled at that time. Other mobile phones also fell off from that bedside table, but they were fine. After all, it was a very short one. I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. Let’s stick a film on it. After all I didn't buy the risk of broken screen. I installed the Glory of Kings, but I couldn't play it because the delay was as high as 300+ whether you were on WiFi or 4G network. I contacted @ Smartisan Technology Customer Service and they asked me for the serial number of my mobile phone or something, but nothing happened later. OK, I just games. I called with that phone. These two days were even better. After dialing the phone, the screen would be black. When the screen was black, the phone was not under my control. If the other party didn't hang up my phone, I won't be able to hang up the phone. I was too scared to call my mother, because my mother always waited for me to hang up the phone. All the keys were just useless. The customer service told me to press the volume key and the lockscreen key for 12 to turn it off. I reported the repair from the official website last night. Today, a customer service person who spoke Mandarin in Fujian accent contacted me and told me that because the screen of my mobile phone was broke, they could not repair the problem of black screen when dialing. This was awesome! The upper right corner of the mobile phone is still a little worn out. Am I supposed to spray some putty and paint on the upper right corner before fixing the black screen? At last I want to ask whether the high delay in the game was because of the broken screen? If it is, I will go home and tear down my wooden floor. If it is not please send me a hammer, I will smash this mobile phone. Show less d"

The incident occurred in Fengxian Xidu Business Office of Shanghai Telecom. I supposed to bring along the equipment (note: the equipment was in good condition) and handle the refund of deposit for the equipment when the broadband expired. There was no notification of the business process, the equipment was returned normally and the business processing voucher was printed. Then an unexpected thing happened: the staff refused to refund the deposit, 200 yuan. Although the amount of money was small, may I ask why your company operates like this? Arrogant and domineering. I reserve the right to complain to the Consumer Protection Commission and bring a lawsuit. I hope you can give a reasonable reply as soon as possible. Show less d"

The customer service of Dongguan Unicom replied that they apologized on behalf of the company for the inconvenience. I can't accept such apologies. They don't even admit the very least fact.",

I only ask for a formal apology. Dongguan Unicom not only failed to apologize but also refused to admit their mistakes. Customer Service Responded as they calling to inform me of the charge is a warm reminder, and they apologized on behalf of the company for any inconvenience caused."

The customer service and technology actively handled the problem. They said because the base station had problems or there was interference. They said that they could handle the problem as quickly as a week and as slowly as a month. The network had ups and downs for a month and a half. Today, they directly cut off the network. Disconnection of the Internet has seriously affected the learning of online classes. Moreover, the Telecom optical fiber is still not repaired, resulting in the poor network environment of the school. Please ask Telecom to try more harder and repair the optical cable of Xinjiang Normal University as soon as possible. And get the base station of Xinjiang Normal University fixed. (Not a complaint) It's just that I can't stand it anymore. I can't connect to the Internet all day. It's a problem lasting for a long time. @ China Telecom Customer Service @ Minzizi @ China Telecom Xinjiang Company Please solve it quickly. Don't call me agian to find out the situation.
